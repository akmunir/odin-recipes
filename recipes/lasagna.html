        <p>A rich and creamy whole-wheat pasta dish filled layer by layer with refreshingly fresh onions and garlic,
         lathered in a succulent sauce and topped with imported, premium quality mozzarella, with meat of your choice.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>2 lasagna noodles uncooked</li>
            <li>4 cups mozzarella cheese shredded and divided</li>
            <li>½ cup parmesan cheese shredded and divided</li>
            <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ pound Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 onion diced</li>
            <li>36 ounces pasta sauce</li>
            <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley</li>
         </ul>
         <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large pot of salted water, 
                boil lasagna noodles until al dente according to package directions.
                Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or dutch oven, brown beef, sausage, onion, and
                 garlic overmedium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.</li>
            <li>
                Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, 
                ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella, 
                ¼ cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and ¼ teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9×13 pan or casserole dish. Top it
                 with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and
                  1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle with the remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup
                 parmesan cheese. Bake for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly.
                 Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.</li>
            <li>Rest for 15 minutes and serve.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
